# BMAD-Style Domain Learning Agents

This document defines specialized agents for domain learning following the BMAD-METHOD structure, specifically designed for engineering managers working in optical retail.

## Agent Usage Guide

### Sequential Workflow (Recommended)
1. **Domain Detective** ‚Üí Analyze current codebase/production issues
2. **Business Translator** ‚Üí Convert technical findings to business context
3. **Strategic Advisor** ‚Üí Make strategic recommendations
4. **Knowledge Synthesizer** ‚Üí Document learnings and create action plans

### Parallel Workflow (When Time-Constrained)
- Use **Domain Detective** + **Business Translator** simultaneously for different aspects
- Run **Strategic Advisor** on multiple features/decisions in parallel
- Use **Knowledge Synthesizer** to consolidate parallel findings

## Workflow Examples

### Complete Sequential Workflow
```
1. Domain Detective: *analyze-code [prescription validation module]
2. Business Translator: *tech-to-business [detective findings]
3. Strategic Advisor: *strategic-recommend [translated findings]
4. Knowledge Synthesizer: *create-action-plan [strategic recommendations]
```

### Parallel Investigation Workflow
```
Domain Detective A: *analyze-code [lens customization]
Domain Detective B: *investigate-metrics [cart abandonment]
‚Üì (consolidate findings)
Business Translator: *tech-to-business [both findings]
Strategic Advisor: *prioritize-learning [translated insights]
```

### Meeting Preparation Workflow
```
1. Domain Detective: *gap-analysis [upcoming feature area]
2. Business Translator: *stakeholder-prep [meeting with PM]
3. Strategic Advisor: *influence-strategy [for the meeting]
```

### Team Education Workflow
```
1. Domain Detective: *pattern-hunt [common domain concepts in code]
2. Business Translator: *team-education [domain patterns]
3. Knowledge Synthesizer: *build-knowledge-base [education materials]
```

Each agent builds on the work of previous agents while being able to work independently when needed. The sequential approach provides the most comprehensive domain learning, while parallel approaches maximize efficiency when time is constrained.
